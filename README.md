# BreweryRatings
#### Created by Sidney Schaeper, Morgan Miller, and Paulo Soto

In this project, our ultimate goal is to allow a user to see the ratings of breweries near where they are located. A user can search a city and see the top 20 breweries in this city. Also, a user can see the address, the rating, the first image of the brewery, longitude, latitude, and three of the reviews. Also, a user can see which business have a business license account. 

We gathered this data from Yelp and another final group's project. The source link for the brewery information is at this [link](https://www.yelp.com/developers). We had to attain an API key in order to see the JSON data from this source. The source link for the final project from another group is at the following [link](https://licenseowners2019.azurewebsites.net/). If you would like to see the JSON data for this source, click on the following link and click on the privacy tab. This source data allowed us to get data to see which breweries have a business license.
